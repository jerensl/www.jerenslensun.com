description: My outreachy Journey through Internship in Servo

---

In this blog post, I would like to reflect on my journey and career path. You might be wondering—what's next?

I have been an intern on the [Servo](https://github.com/servo/servo/) project through the Outreachy program, from June 1, 2025, to August 31, 2025. My work focused on CI/CD using GitHub Actions and improving the developer experience through the `mach` command-line tool, which helps with Servo development.

## Servo
Servo is a prototype web browser engine written in the [Rust](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) programming language. It aims to provide developers with a lightweight, high-performance alternative for embedding web technologies into applications.

My journey with Servo wouldn’t have been possible without the guidance of my mentors, [Martin Robinson](https://github.com/mrobinson) and [Mukilan Thiyagarajan](https://github.com/mukilan/). Both have been instrumental in helping me navigate a large codebase—offering valuable advice during meetings and reviewing my pull requests to ensure they could be merged into the repository.

Even though the internship officially ends on August 31, I plan to continue contributing to Servo. I’ve come to enjoy the rhythm and spirit of open source and the Servo community is one I’d love to stay part of.

## Looking Ahead
As I think about what comes next, one thing is clear: I want to keep growing by building in the open.

Ideally, I’d love to work at a company that values and supports open source contributions. I truly believe that working in the open — alongside people who care deeply about what they build — accelerates both personal growth and technical excellence. Open source is a place where shared ideas become real progress, and I want to keep being part of that.

## Career Goals
I've found a strong sense of purpose in improving the **developer experience**, particularly through **CI/CD pipelines** and **developer tooling** such as command-line interfaces. I thrive in remote environments that allow for deep focus and meaningful contributions to tools that help teams ship faster and with greater confidence.

Beyond infrastructure and tooling, I also build **web products and features**, primarily using **React-based frameworks like Next.js**—translating ideas into functional, valuable software.

If you're curious about the kind of work I do, here are some open-source projects I've contributed to:

- [**Servo – PRs Merged**](https://github.com/servo/servo/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajerensl+is%3Amerged+): CI/CD, developer tooling, and command-line workflows
    
- [**Meshery – PRs Merged**](https://github.com/meshery/meshery/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3Ajerensl+is%3Amerged+): E2E Testing and infrastructure contributions
    
- [**AsyncAPI / Modelina – PRs Merged**](https://github.com/asyncapi/modelina/pulls?q=is%3Apr+is%3Amerged+author%3Ajerensl+):  Build a feature and developer tooling improvements

## Let's Connect
If you'd like to work with me, I’ll be available starting **September 1, 2025**.
