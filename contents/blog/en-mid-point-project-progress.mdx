Hi, I been internship for one month and two weeks on the Servo project through the Outreachy program. I work with CI/CD pipelines, as well as developer tooling.

Since I am working as the Intern of Servo, my project plan focusing on adding annotation into Github Action linter, in addition to adding Type check for python codebase. My project focuses on improving the developer experience when dealing with linting and type checking.

I accomplished several objectives during this internship. So far, I have successfully added annotations in GitHub Actions for Rust Clippy and the mach test-tidy command, and in doing so, also introduced type checking for the Python codebase using Pyrefly.

We been implemented [Workflow Command](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/workflow-commands-for-github-actions#using-workflow-commands-to-access-toolkit-functions) from github action to implement inline annotation which been integrated deeply on `python/tidy` codebases in [this pr](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37294).

We also trying to improve the speed of test-tidy by implementating python multirpcoessing as you can check on [this pr](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37748).

To organazire all config in python we also choose to consolidate multiple config like for ruff and pyrefly under pyproject config in [this pr](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/37741).

We are now at the point to add type strictness to all python codebase from [this pr](https://github.com/servo/servo/pull/38043) that are landed in base branch to address all type check on tidy codebases.

During the second half of my internship, I will keep adding and correcting type check arround python codebase and will be working on other next task. Overall I'm happy with current progress being made and looking to improve more
