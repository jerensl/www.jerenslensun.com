I've been contributing to open source for about a year, focusing on CI/CD with GitHub Actions, end-to-end testing using Playwright, and building and improving web projects. I'm currently stepping into my next challenge as a **Servo intern through Outreachy**, where I'm excited to push my skills further and contribute to a next generation browser engine project.

**My motivation for applying to Outreachy** is rooted in the belief that **diversity leads to better, more inclusive projects**. When people from different backgrounds collaborate, we reduce bias, build with broader perspectives, and create solutions that are **genuinely accessible and meaningful to more people**.

**I chose Servo as my Outreachy project** out of a growing frustration with how many projects approach the same problems in fragmented ways. Too often, new frameworks introduce unnecessary overhead and shift how we build things without addressing the underlying fundamentals that truly shape performance and usability. Instead of joining the endless cycle of framework wars, I chose to contribute to Servo a project focused on improving the core of how the web works. For me, it’s about going deeper, not wider.

## 3 Core Values

### 1. **Essential Design**

I believe that great design stands the test of time. Whether I’m buying a product, designing a system, or writing code, **functionality always comes first—long before any ornamentation**. My design philosophy is inspired by the **Monobloc chair**, first designed over **70 years ago** by Canadian designer D.C. Simpson. You’ve probably seen it on the street stackable, lightweight, affordable, and used around the world for one simple reason: **it works**. To me, that’s the benchmark of great design **timeless, accessible, and built around real human needs**.

### 2. **Purposeful Independence**

I build by first seeking deep understanding. I value having control over abstraction not avoiding it, but knowing when and how to use it. What matters most is the **freedom to navigate between layers**, and that freedom comes from **competence, not shortcuts**.

### 3. **Radical Truth**  

I value people who are direct and unafraid to give hard feedback. Honesty matters deeply to me but I believe it lands best when it comes from a place of trust. Build the relationship first, show you care, and then speak the truth.

**If you're from an underrepresented group and interested in working on open source as an intern**, I highly recommend the Outreachy program. It's a valuable opportunity to contribute meaningfully, grow your skills, and be part of a supportive global community.
