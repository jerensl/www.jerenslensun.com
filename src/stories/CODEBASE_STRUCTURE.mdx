These are the directories that we are actively using in the development:

-   [src/pages](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/pages):
    This folder contains all the pages of your app. Each page is usually stored in its own subfolder.
-   [src/components](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/components):
    This folder contains reusable components that can be used throughout the application pages.
-   [src/libs](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/libs):
    This folder contains third-party libraries or the implementation of the library that are used in the application. For example, you can store all your API functions in a file called api.ts.
-   [src/util](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/util):
    This folder contains utility functions that can be used throughout the application.
-   [src/types](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/types):
    This folder contains types that can be used throughout the application.
-   [src/constant](https://github.com/jerensl/www.jerensl.com/tree/main/src/constant):
    This folder contains all the constants that you use in your app. For example, you can store all your color codes in a file called colors.ts.
